# Psynamic Lab

**Machine Learning for Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience & Psychiatry**  
*Goethe University Frankfurt & Ernst Strüngmann Institute (ESI)*

---

The **Psynamic Lab**, led by Dr. Manuel Brenner, develops interpretable machine learning models to understand real-world dynamical systems in the brain — from latent cognitive trajectories to network-level neurophysiological dynamics.

We are embedded in the [LOEWE-Center DYNAMIC](https://www.dynamic-center.net/), bridging **basic neuroscience at the Ernst Strüngmann Institute (ESI)** with **clinical psychiatry at Goethe University Frankfurt**. Our research leverages multimodal time series data (EEG, fMRI, spike trains, behavior) to uncover latent processes driving cognition and mental health.

## 🔬 Research Focus

- **Interpretable latent-state models** of neural and behavioral dynamics  
- **Symbolic representations** and **discrete attractor codes** in RNNs  
- **Multimodal integration** of brain signals, behavior, and environment  
- **Network-based modeling** of psychiatric disorders and perturbations  
- **Bridging AI and neuroscience** for clinical and translational insight

---

## 📍 Environment

The Psynamic Lab is part of the interdisciplinary **DYNAMIC Consortium**, supported by the state of Hesse, and situated at the interface of theory and practice. We collaborate closely with computational neuroscientists, psychiatrists, and AI researchers — aiming to develop models that are both **mechanistically grounded** and **clinically actionable**.
